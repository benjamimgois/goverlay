# Goverlay

GOverlay is an open source project aimed to create a Graphical UI to manage Vulkan/OpenGL overlays. It is still in early development, so it lacks a lot of features.

This project was only possible thanks to the other maintainers and contributors that have done the hard work. I am just a Network Engineer that really likes Linux and Gaming.

#### Ubuntu

To install goverlay in Ubuntu (20.04 and up) and derivatives, you need to install libqt6pas that isn't provided by official repo, but
you can grab it in https://github.com/davidbannon/libqt6pas

```bash
sudo apt-get update
wget https://github.com/davidbannon/libqt6pas/releases/download/v6.2.8/libqt6pas6_6.2.8-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libqt6pas6_6.2.8-1_amd64.deb
tar -zxvf goverlay*.tar.gz
./goverlay
```

To avoid a issue with libdl.so on ubuntu based distros it's recomended to build Mangohud from source.

## Tarball

1. Download the latest tarball from [Releases](https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases).

2. Extract the file by running the following command:

```bash
tar -xvf goverlay*.tar.xz
```

3. Properly execute the binary inside the tar file:

```bash
./goverlay
```

Note: Since version 0.6.4 mangohud needs to be installed to run GOverlay.

## Source

### Prerequisites

Before building, you will need to install the following:

 - [Lazarus](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/lazarus/lazarus) - IDE

### Building

To build GOverlay, clone the git repository by running following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay.git
```

Then, change directory and build GOverlay by running the following commands:

```bash
cd goverlay
make
```

### Running

Start GOverlay with:

```bash
./goverlay
```

Note: Since version 0.6.4 mangohud needs to be installed to run GOverlay.

### Installing

To install GOverlay execute:

```bash
make install
```

This will install the start script to `/usr/local/bin/goverlay`, so that it can be launched via `goverlay` in the console. 


## Theme compatibility

Since Goverlay 0.9 the official supported themes are Breeze (plasma) and Adwaita (Gnome). If you run into issues with your current one you can force goverlay to run with a specific theme:

```bash
goverlay --style breeze
```
or
```bash
goverlay --style fusion
```
